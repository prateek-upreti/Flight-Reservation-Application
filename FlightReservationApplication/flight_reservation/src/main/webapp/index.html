	<h2>What is Hacking</h2>
	<p>Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, 
	   smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. And while hacking might not always be for 
	   malicious purposes, nowadays most references to hacking, and hackers, characterize it/them 
	   as unlawful activity by cyber-criminals‚Äîmotivated by financial gain, protest, information 
	   gathering (spying), and even just for the ‚Äúfun‚Äù of the challenge.</p>
	   
	<p>Hacking is typically technical in nature (like creating mal-vertising that deposits
	   in a drive-by attack requiring no user interaction). But hackers can also use psychology to 
	   trick the user into clicking on a malicious attachment or providing personal data. These 
	   tactics are referred to as social engineering.Äù</p>
